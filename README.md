# Lab 8 - *Swiping*

**Swiping* is a mock Tindr app featuring gestures and custom transitions

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** user stories are complete:

- [x] User can drag card using a pan gesture (+1pt)
- [x] Card rotates as user pans (+1pt)
- [x] Card animates when user ends panning gesture (+2pt)
- [x] User can view profile - basic modal transition (+1pt)

The following **stretch** user stories are implemented:

- [ ] User can view profile - custom modal transition (+2pt)

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. I would like to discuss how to pull pictures from a server or the internets and use them on the swiping animation.
2.
